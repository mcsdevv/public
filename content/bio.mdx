Hio! Iâ€™m a people-centric Product Manager, and for the past few years I've been
working at [Google](https://www.google.com/about) on the Identity team to improve
the security and usability of [Google Accounts](https://myaccount.google.com/)
for the billions of people around the world who depend on them.

Before Google, I worked at [Facebook](http://about.fb.com/), building and improving
the universal library of design components used across the Core App, powering a major
[News Feed refresh](https://medium.com/facebook-design/evolving-the-facebook-news-feed-to-serve-you-better-f844a5cb903d),
and bootstrapping new product initiatives with high quality and flexible UI and UX to let them focus on finding product-to-market fit.

Before moving to the beautiful Bay Area, I was a New England Native.
In Boston, I was a Product Director for [Tripadvisor](https://tripadvisor.mediaroom.com/US-about-us), leading a team that focused
on improving the design and UX of our web and mobile properties.

In the early 2000s, I worked for some smaller companies (like Rue La La)
and startups (like Online Buddies, Manhunt, DList) after graduating from the
University of Rhode Island with a major in Computer Science and minor in
Communication Studies.
