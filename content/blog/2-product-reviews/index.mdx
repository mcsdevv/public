title: Deliver a people-friendly Product Review
description: 'Lots of PMs face the “I have no idea what I’m doing” moment. It’s common, it sucks, and it can make us feel stuck. To get un-stuck, get specific.'
tldr: 'With limited time and no guarantees that attendees are up-to-speed on your product, how you communicate during your Product Review is as important as the content itself. Plan with your specific audience in mind to make the most of your time together.'

No two organizations “do Product Reviews” the same way.
In fact, at larger organizations (like Google), different product areas have
different expectations for Product Reviews.
And—hold on to your hat—even within the same department,
it’s possible that the meeting on your calendar called _Product Review_ will
serve a different purpose between occurrences.

> Spoiler alert: There’s no magic series of events, or recitations of Product Mangers past that make a meeting a Product Review.

Meeting naming conventions aside: these recurring meetings tend to involve stakeholders and other cross-functional partners and usually have an agenda that includes:

- **Looking back:** What did the team finish, launch (or kill) lately; how did it go? What did we learn? What can we apply?
- **Looking around:** How is our product performing _now_? What are current, past and potential **customers** saying and doing? What does the market **landscape** look like? How are things going **internally** within the org?
- **Looking ahead:** What is the team working towards next (e.g. shipping code, researching, prototyping)? What decisions did we make, or have to make?


You’ll notice that this list has a lot of question marks!
And, in 30 minutes (maybe 60 if you’re lucky), there’s no way you’ll be
able to answer all of them. **Nor should you!**

As Product people, we’re constantly going on about “product-market fit”
and “user empathy.” **And we should!** Not only in our products,
but in how we approach internal alignment and communication—we should
make sure we understand who we’re presenting to, what they want out of us,
and what we need from them.

## Be intentional

**Hint: there’s no such thing as “_just to give an update_”**
If your review is nothing more than an update, then I’d suggest writing an
email and giving everyone back their time.

The first thing that helped me craft better product reviews
was to get out of the mindset that I was there to **inform.**
While that certainly was a byproduct of my presentations,
it wasn’t the primary, or even most important part.

> Personally, I view Product Reviews as a way to achieve an outcome I wouldn’t otherwise be able to, without the synchronous attention of the people who are attending.

## Create a plan

I’ve refined a lightweight framework that I still use to this
day when planning out my product reviews, but it really can be used for
any communication where you want to be more intentional about
delivering an actionable message.

In this document, I’ve outlined some of the questions I ask of myself
and of my attendees to make sure I understand why we’re here.
In the margins, I’ve also added some tips and tricks that I look for, too.

Grab a copy; feel free to make a copy and adapt it to your needs.
And, of course, send any feedback my way.
